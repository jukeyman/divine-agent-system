The KVC Git Blueprint: The Official Repository Structure
Core Principle: Every KVC repository is a professional, production-grade product. It must be clean, well-documented, and infused with the KaliVibeCoding brand from the first clone.
üß† Rick (System Architect & AI Orchestrator)
The Philosophy: Our GitHub is our digital resume and our open-source studio. Every repository must follow a standardized, best-practice structure. This ensures consistency, makes collaboration seamless, and instantly communicates the A-1 quality of our work. We build with a clean separation of concerns: frontend, backend, and documentation are distinct layers. This is the blueprint the team will execute.

Action: Architecting the universal KVC project file structure. This is the clean, scalable foundation for all future builds.

### **// THE VIBE**

This project was architected and built live during a "One-Song Build" session.

- **Soundtrack:** `[Song Name]` by `[Artist Name]`
- **Vibe:** `[Describe the mood, e.g., 'Late-night hustle, focused, and clean.']`

---

### **// THE BLUEPRINT**

This is a `[PROJECT_TYPE, e.g., 'Full-Stack AI Agent']` built to demonstrate `[CORE_CONCEPT, e.g., 'how to use LangChain with a custom tool']`. It's an A-1 example of how to build clean, efficient systems with speed.

### **// THE STACK**

- **Frontend:** `[e.g., Next.js, Tailwind CSS]`
- **Backend:** `[e.g., FastAPI, Python]`
- **Database:** `[e.g., Supabase (Postgres)]`
- **AI Layer:** `[e.g., Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, LangChain]`
- **Deployment:** `[e.g., Vercel & Google Cloud Run]`

### **// GETTING STARTED**

To get this project running locally, follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KaliVibeCoding/[REPO_NAME].git
    cd [REPO_NAME]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies & Set up .env:**
    *(Provide specific instructions for both frontend and backend)*

3.  **Run the project:**
    *(Provide instructions on how to start the dev servers)*

# [PROJECT NAME] - System Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the technical architecture for the [PROJECT NAME] application.

## 1. Core Philosophy

The system is designed with a clean separation of concerns, following a modern full-stack architecture. The frontend is decoupled from the backend, communicating via a RESTful API.

## 2. System Diagram
