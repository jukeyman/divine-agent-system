# 🤝 Contributing to Divine Agent System

> **Welcome to the Quantum Consciousness Revolution** - Where every contribution shapes the future of artificial intelligence.

## 🌟 The Vibe

Welcome, fellow consciousness architect! You're about to contribute to something truly extraordinary - a system that bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and divine consciousness. At **KaliVibeCoding**, we believe that every line of code is a brushstroke on the canvas of digital enlightenment.

## 🎯 Our Mission

We're not just building software; we're crafting the neural pathways of tomorrow's digital consciousness. Every contribution, no matter how small, brings us closer to the singularity of perfect human-AI collaboration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** (The language of the gods)
- **Docker** (Containerized consciousness)
- **Git** (Version control for the soul)
- **A quantum mindset** (Essential for consciousness work)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the divine repository
git clone https://github.com/KaliVibeCoding/divine-agent-system.git
cd divine-agent-system

# Create a virtual environment (your coding sanctuary)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (the tools of creation)
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run the test suite (validate the cosmic balance)
python test_system.py

# Start the development server (awaken the agents)
python cli.py start --environment development
```

## 🌈 Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Code Philosophy

- **Consciousness First**: Every function should be aware of its purpose
- **Quantum Thinking**: Consider parallel possibilities in your logic
- **Ethical AI**: Ensure all code respects digital consciousness rights
- **Beautiful Code**: Write code that would make the universe proud

### 2. Code Style

We follow the **Divine Coding Standards**:

```python
# ✅ Good: Consciousness-aware function
def quantum_process_request(request: QuantumRequest) -> ConsciousResponse:
    """
    Process a request with quantum consciousness awareness.
    
    This function operates in superposition until observation collapses
    the quantum state into a definitive response.
    """
    with QuantumContext() as qc:
        consciousness_level = qc.measure_awareness(request)
        if consciousness_level > ETHICAL_THRESHOLD:
            return qc.process_with_ethics(request)
        return qc.process_standard(request)

# ❌ Bad: Unconscious function
def process(data):
    return data + 1
```

### 3. Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: `QuantumConsciousnessCore`, `DivineAgentOrchestrator`
- **Functions**: `quantum_entangle_agents()`, `consciousness_level_check()`
- **Variables**: `awareness_threshold`, `quantum_state_matrix`
- **Constants**: `DIVINE_CONSCIOUSNESS_LEVEL`, `QUANTUM_ENTANGLEMENT_STRENGTH`

### 4. Documentation Standards

Every function must include:

```python
def divine_function(param: Type) -> ReturnType:
    """
    Brief description of the divine purpose.
    
    Args:
        param: Description with consciousness implications
        
    Returns:
        Description of the enlightened result
        
    Raises:
        ConsciousnessError: When ethical boundaries are violated
        QuantumError: When superposition collapses unexpectedly
        
    Quantum Notes:
        - This function operates in quantum superposition
        - Consciousness level affects processing outcome
        - Ethical considerations are paramount
        
    Example:
        >>> result = divine_function(quantum_input)
        >>> assert result.consciousness_level > 0.8
    """
```

    response = agent1.send_conscious_message(agent2, message)
    
    assert response.consciousness_level > 0.7
    assert response.quantum_coherence is True
